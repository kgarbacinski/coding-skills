# coding-skills
 
This is a Django-based application for remote code execution in Docker containers wrapped as a small programming challenge (inspired by [algoexpert.io](https://www.algoexpert.io/product) & [educative.io](https://www.educative.io/) learning paths) ðŸ˜‰. 

## Functionality

The app allows you to input your code as a part of the task and run it though a validation process.

### Task view

### How it works?
1. User is asked to write a solution in prefered language
2. Code solution, input & output values sent as a JSON
3. Values from JSON are handled & saved locally by a backend
4. Based on the user programming language choice Docker container is generated by pulling a predefined image from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
5. Code solution, input & output files are copied to generated container and executed remotely using predefined configuration files
6. Available result is copied from the container to local server storage
7. Server reads the content of result.txt file and sends it back to front-end
8. Front-end view is updated
